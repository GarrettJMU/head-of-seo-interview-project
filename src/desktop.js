    <p>We‚Äôve talked to many of our pros about what it took to start their business, and the numbers were all over
      the place. Every business‚Äôs financial needs vary based on location, specialization, and fluctuations in the
      economy. Here are some things to consider when calculating the funds you‚Äôll need to start a business and
      where to seek help.</p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Add up your business expenses</li>
      <li>Estimate your initial monthly revenue</li>
      <li>Calculate your <a rel="nofollow"

        point
      </a>
      </li>
      <li>Figure out your business credit score</li>
      <li>Compare financial options for your startup costs</li>
      <li>Write a business plan</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Case Study</h1>
    <p>In 2005, Darryl Nocera sold his plumbing company, including five service trucks, in order to focus on his
      young kids. He worked for another company for the next fourteen years until his kids were grown. In 2019, he
      was finally ready to work for himself again.</p>
    <p>Darryl saved for several years to be able to go out on his own. He already had his master plumber license
      and tools; he also intentionally kept costs low by choosing to work out of his house. Here were his initial
      expenses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>$2,000 down on a brand new truck</li>
      <li>Around $500 on the business cards, uniforms, and patches for the uniforms</li>
      <li>Around $2,000 on a website</li>
      <li>$800 a month advertising budget</li>
      <li>$1,600 for equipment he didn't already have</li>
    </ul>
    <p>"I had everything except drain equipment. I recently added a drain machine that was over $1600 because my
      business demanded it, and rental charges from home depot were no longer justifiable."</p>
    <h1>Assessing Your Financial Options</h1>
    <p>Of course, if you‚Äôre able to spend a couple of years saving up, like Darryl, that‚Äôs the best option. But if
      you‚Äôre not able to save everything you need, there are other business financing options.</p>
    <p>Brand new businesses that haven‚Äôt started making revenue, don‚Äôt typically qualify for a regular commercial
      loan. Common alternatives to commercial lending include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Startup loans</li>
      <li>Microloans</li>
      <li>Friends and family loan</li>
      <li>Small Business Administration loan</li>
      <li>Home equity loans</li>
      <li>Business credit card</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Pro Tip: Look For Federal or State-level Small Business Grants</h2>
    <p>There are many ways you can leverage assistance from external organizations and the government. Look to see
      if your state and local municipalities offer assistance to small businesses. Many offer local grants, tax
      deductions, and free coaching opportunities.</p>
    <p>In addition, certain business owners who qualify as socially or economically challenged can apply for their
      business to be certified as women-owned or minority-owned ‚Äî a status that comes with various benefits.</p>
    <h1>Creating a Plumbing Business Plan</h1>
    <p>Before you take out any loans, you need a detailed plan for your business. The Small Business Alliance
      offers a helpful step-by-step guide to writing a business plan. Also, view an example of a plumbing business
      plan.</p>
    <p>Most lenders will require a business plan, but don‚Äôt just write it for them. Taking the time to craft a
      business plan will help give you direction, as well. Much of what we cover in this guide can go into your
      business plan, such as who your target customer is and how you plan on reaching them.</p>
    <h1>Plumbing Business Legal Requirements</h1>
    <p>If you‚Äôve worked as a plumber, you‚Äôre already aware of the licensing requirements of your state. But to run
      your own business, you‚Äôll also need to register your business on the federal, state and local levels,
      including registering for a tax ID. You‚Äôll need this ID to open a business banking account and get insured.
      If you‚Äôre not sure how to register, you can work with a registered agent.</p>
    <p>üëâSee <a rel="nofollow" href="/working-in-the-trades/">plumbing licensing requirements</a> in detail
    </p>
    <h3>Steps> </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Make sure you have all the licenses you need</li>
      <li>Incorporate and register your business</li>
      <li>Apply for a tax ID</li>
      <li>Open business bank account</li>
      <li>Apply for insurance and bonding</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Shopping For Insurance</h1>
    <p>Shop for insurance through an independent broker that works with multiple insurance companies. They can
      help you shop around for the best price. Also ask other contractors what companies they work with.</p>
    <h1>The Technical Stuff</h1>
    <p>For a lot of new plumbing companies, the technical stuff is the most overwhelming. To make things easier,
      we‚Äôve outlined the types of tools you‚Äôll need to get started and some of the exact brands that our pros
      regularly talk about and use.</p>
    <h3>Steps></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Set up a website and social media profiles</li>
      <li>Shop for and invest in tech platforms</li>
      <li>Create calls-to-action (CTAs) on your website and social media profiles</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Why Offer Online Booking</h1>
    <p>Did you know that 56% of people are frustrated with the inconveniences of scheduling over the phone?
      With
      over 30% of people more likely to choose a business that offers online books, it‚Äôs a wise choice to have
      online bookings (especially if you‚Äôre new and just starting!). If you're curious about where to start
      your
      search, have a look at our <a href="https://www.housecallpro.com/industries/plumbing-software/?mc=display&msc=hvac-may2020-halfoffsaas-6months">plumbing
        software</a> to start.</p>
    <h1>Plumbing Tools and Equipment</h1>
    <p>Whether you‚Äôre on a budget or looking for high-quality, sturdy equipment, we‚Äôve listed a few different
      options below.</p>
    <h3>Steps></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Assess and fill tool inventory</li>
      <li>Rent office front and/or warehouse space (if needed)</li>
      <li>Invest in a service van or truck</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Invest in Uniforms</h1>
    <p>Did you know 75% of customers prefer it when auto workers wear uniforms? Plumbing professionals are
      no different. Uniforms can make you look more professional and will help boost brand awareness. Even
      if you‚Äôre a one-person shop, you can order one with your logo. It‚Äôs not too expensive and can add a
      lot of value to your brand!</p>
    <h1>Choosing the Right Service Vehicle</h1>
    <p>The largest single expense for new plumbing businesses is often a service van or truck. Thankfully
      auto loans tend to be easier to obtain and have lower interest rates than other business loans. Check
      out our list of different plumbing vans you should consider. The list also dives into detail what
      plumbing tools need to go in the van, and helpful tips on how to keep the vehicle neat and tidy!</p>
    <h1>Your Target Market and Specialization</h1>
    <p>Here‚Äôs where we get into the finer strategy of your business. Do your website and the rest of your
      branding efforts speak to the people you most want to do business with? Your messaging should speak
      directly to your ideal customer. Knowing who you want to work with on what kinds of projects will help
      you fine-tune your business plan and brand.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Outline your target market and ideal customer</li>
      <li>Decide if you want to specialize</li>
      <li>Update your brand messaging and service offerings accordingly</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Your Target Market and Ideal Customer</h1>
    <p>‚ÄúIf we can see Joe Jones through Joe Jones‚Äô eyes, then we can sell what Joe Jones buys ‚Ä¶ That
      messaging and that clarity of who our customer is, informs how we write the content for our website,
      how we write our social posts, the types of TV ads that we run, the types of YouTube video ads that we
      run.‚Äù Josh Nelson, Plumbing and HVAC ‚Äî Internet Marketing Podcast</p>
    <p>So who is your ideal customer? The vast majority of residential plumbers target homeowners, but there
      are other options, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Builders and General Contractors:</span> If you love working
        with new construction or remodels, builders and contractors can become great clients or partners as
        they‚Äôre always in need of a plumber to install the plumbing systems.
      </li>
      <li><span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Realtors and Property Managers:</span> Realtors commonly
        recommend professionals that can assist with property maintenance before or after a sale. Meanwhile,
        property managers can keep you busy maintaining multifamily properties or houses they rent out. A
        newer group to target are folks who maintain rental properties through sites like Airbnb or Turnkey.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Outline your target market and the specific individuals you want to work with. Include everything you
      can about their demographic. Where do they live? What‚Äôs their average salary? Are they married or
      single? Finally, what do they care most about when it comes to plumbing services?</p>
    <p>Pro-tip: Look at the reviews of your competition. What do people mention most often, both positively
      and negatively? This can give you an idea of what they value highly</p>
    <h1>Do You Want to Specialize?</h1>
    <p>Examples of specializations include new construction, home warranty, or high-end plumbing. Check out
      other specializations to consider.</p>
    <p>Roger Wakefield, a plumbing business owner with over 38 years of experience, advises people to ask
      themselves whether they like to build or fix things. Understanding what you enjoy will help you make
      the tough decisions when it comes to picking a direction for your plumbing business.</p>
    <p>When it comes to specialties, make sure you select an area that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Has demand in the market</li>
      <li>Is something you‚Äôre outstanding at</li>
      <li>Is something you enjoy</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Setting Your Plumbing Services and Rates</h1>
    <h3>Steps></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a list of services you‚Äôre able or interested in offering</li>
      <li>Create a plumbing price list for all of your services</li>
      <li>Choose between a flat rate or time and materials pricing structure</li>
      <li>Create a contract template</li>
      <li>Write up a terms and conditions document</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Setting Your Rates</h1>
    <p>Your previous experience and industry standards can be a great benchmark when it comes to setting
      your rates. But when you‚Äôre running your business, there are a lot of additional expenses you might
      not have considered when working as a tech. </p>
    <p>We recommend you start with a plumbing services pricing list based on how long the average project
      takes and roughly how much it will cost. With a price list, you can do a flat-rate pricing system or
      hourly approach.</p>
    <p>The biggest decision when it comes to setting your rates is whether to offer flat rate or hourly
      services. See a fuller list of the benefits and challenges of hourly and flat rate pricing. Also,
      check out a sample plumbing flat rate menu from our partner Labtorio.</p>
    <h1>Plumbing Marketing and Advertising</h1>
    <p>If you don‚Äôt have an existing customer base, positive reviews, or presence in your local community
      yet, those initial leads are hard to come by. But before you spend tons of money on advertising, we
      recommend building up your online presence and in-person networking. These strategies can save you
      money in the long-run and help you find organic leads.</p>
    <h3>Steps></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a marketing plan</li>
      <li>Design business cards, van wrap, and other marketing materials</li>
      <li>Sign up for Google My Business</li>
      <li>Claim your business on other lead generation platforms</li>
      <li>Optimize your website for search engines (SEO)</li>
      <li>Join digital and in-person networking groups</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Do You Need to Pay for Advertising?</h1>
    <p>When you‚Äôre starting out, it might be tempting to push tons of promotions just to get your name
      out there and get the phone ringing. We‚Äôre not saying you shouldn‚Äôt run ads for your new business,
      but there are other ways (free ways) to accomplish these goals, as well. Here are some of our
      favorites:</p>
    <h3>Start with your Family and Friends</h3>
    <p>This might sound like a no-brainer, but have you reached out to your network to tell them about
      your new business? Consider sending a mass email (bcc everyone to protect their privacy) and offer
      a friends and family discount. Ask them to share the email with others.</p>
    <h3>Become Active in Local Facebook Groups</h3>
    <p>Most regions have Facebook groups for local homeowners associations, small businesses, local
      moms, etc. Introducing yourself can begin to build name recognition of your business. </p>
    <h3>Get Involved with Local Business Groups</h3>
    <p>Many of our pros recommend organizations like Business Network International (BNI) that are
      designed to build local referral networks.</p>
    <h3>Network with Local Pros</h3>
    <p>We maintain local meetups for pros in over a dozen areas across the U.S. These meetups offer pros
      an opportunity to network with each other and referrals are highly encouraged.</p>
    <h1>Focus on Customer Retention Over New Leads</h1>
    <p>Building strong relationships with your customers is critical to your long-term success. It‚Äôs
      costly to serve only one-off customers and not a sustainable approach to business. That‚Äôs why your
      ultimate goal should be to turn first-time consumers into lifelong customers.</p>
    <p>To continue the relationship after the service, we recommend you also use follow-up marketing
      tools to make sure your customer is satisfied and remembers your business.</p>
    <h1>Hiring</h1>
    <p>Staff is probably the biggest stumbling blocks to growth. You can‚Äôt grow without the right team.
      But you can‚Äôt hire the right team without enough initial growth to sustain another person‚Äôs
      salary. The first thing we‚Äôll look at in this section is how to know when you‚Äôre ready to
      hire.</p>
    <h3>Steps></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Assess the numbers (what can you afford?)</li>
      <li>Research the legal requirements (federal, state, and local) of hiring someone</li>
      <li>Outline the hiring and onboarding processes</li>
      <li>Set up functions to handle salary and benefits</li>
      <li>Create job listing ad</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>How to Know When You‚Äôre Ready</h1>
    <p>If you‚Äôre turning down work or don‚Äôt have time to work on the business, then perhaps it‚Äôs time
      to hire someone. Some plumbing businesses start out with an additional part-time technician or
      office assistant. It‚Äôs a much bigger leap to hire someone full-time. The biggest hurdle here is
      whether your business will remain stable enough to sustain another person‚Äôs salary.</p>
    <p>Before posting that ad, here are some things to consider:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Look at your numbers.</span> Analyze your revenue over as
        long of a time period as you can. If you see continuous growth over a six or 12-month period,
        there are better chances that you‚Äôll be able to sustain growth after hiring.It‚Äôs also helpful
        to know roughly how many new customers you‚Äôll need to support an employee. Have a plan for how
        you‚Äôll get and maintain these new customers.
      </li>
      <li><span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Be prepared to onboard quickly.</span> The longer it takes
        to train someone, the longer you‚Äôll be covering their salary without your new hire pulling
        their own weight. Have all training processes thought out before posting a position.
      </li>
      <li><span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Leverage technology first.</span> Technology can help you
        speed up and simplify much of running your business. When you‚Äôre able to streamline your
        business processes, you‚Äôll be in better shape to train a new hire and make the most of your
        time in the field.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>A Happy One Man Operation</h1>
    <p>Not every business owner dreams of growing their company beyond what they can handle on their
      own. Take Darryl Nocera. Darryl has done just about everything: run a company with multiple
      techs working under him, worked for someone else, and now he‚Äôs content running a one-man
      operation:</p>
    <p>‚ÄúIt gives me control over every job that's done. I'm also very customer-oriented, and I don't
      just create a customer base. I like to actually relationships with my customers. I'll sit down,
      and they'll invite me in to the coffee table and have coffee and we'll talk about everything
      that has to do with anything except plumbing for 30 minutes, an hour. Just developing that
      relationship with the customer.</p>
    <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not all about money, but obviously we get into business because we want to be able to
      support ourselves. So you can open up a business and have three, four, or five trucks running,
      and as an owner, after everything's said and done, you can make $100,000 to $300,000 a year. Or
      you can go out on your own, not have the headaches and all the overhead, and come pretty close
      to that same type of revenue.‚Äù Darryl Nocera</p>
    <p>Whether you want to keep your operations small or grow to seven digits and beyond, that‚Äôs one
      of the benefits of running your own company: it‚Äôs your vision, your decision.</p>
